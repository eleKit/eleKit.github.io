abstract: Introduction This study presents MiEmo, a multi-modal digital platform designed
  to improve emotion recognition in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC).
  The platform integrates serious games with music and color as feedback mechanisms
  to strengthen emotion understanding in addition to traditional visual interventions
  such as pictures and videos. The study aims to assess the usability and potential
  effectiveness of MiEmo in supporting therapy for children with medium- and high-functioning
  ASC. Methods A pilot usability study was conducted in two rehabilitation centers
  involving 19 children, 8 with medium and 11 with high functioning ASC. Participants
  engaged with six training activities, or exergames, on the MiEmo platform that implemented
  multi-modal feedback (music pieces and colored animations associated to the emotion).
  The System Usability Scale (SUS) and qualitative feedback from therapists were used
  to evaluate the platform's usability. Results The average SUS scores were 86.88
  for children with medium-functioning ASC and 96.75 for those with high-functioning
  ASC, indicating positive usability. Therapists noted that while the platform was
  well-received, further updates are needed for better adaptation to medium-functioning
  children. Multi-modal feedback, particularly music and color, was found to enhance
  emotion recognition, with children responding well to the integration of these sensory
  cues. Conclusion The study demonstrates that MiEmo has significant potential as
  a tool for socio-emotional training, particularly for high-functioning children.
  However, limitations such as the small sample size, short intervention duration,
  and lack of a control group suggest that future studies with larger participant
  groups are necessary to validate these findings and assess long-term effects.
