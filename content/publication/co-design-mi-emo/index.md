abstract: We describe the co-design process of a platform based on exergames for a
  novel multi-modal intervention on the recognition of emotions for children (4--8Â years
  old) with medium or high functioning Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). Rich feedback
  through animations, music, colors, and gestures emerged from the co-design process
  and is central to the platform.
