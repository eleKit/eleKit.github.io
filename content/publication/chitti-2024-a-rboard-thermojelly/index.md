abstract: 'The project aims to explore the game mechanics to design a competitive
  AR board game that enables interaction between players. We explore existing best
  practices of AR design, and apply them in the development of Themojelly, a local
  multiplayer board game in AR for smartphones that integrates virtual elements with
  tangible interfaces. In Thermojelly, each player controls with a joystick shown
  on his/her smartphone a virtual avatar, with the shape of a jelly, and can play
  with two different party mini-games, both with the play goal to run and jump across
  the path designed using the physical board. The board is composed of 8 squared tiles
  and the players will personalize the map by placing the tiles on a desk, each tile
  represents an obstacle or an help for the avatar to race to the goal. The players
  can place the tiles both horizontally or at different heights (for example putting
  a tile on a pile of books), exploring different physical interaction modalities.
  The coordinates of all the virtual objects are computed with respect to a shared
  physical space: for a fluid AR multiplayer each player with the smartphone will
  have a different point of view of the same real and virtual worlds. Through this
  approach different players share the same play space, and visualize in contemporary
  all the events happening in the game from different points of view. To assess usability
  and playersâ€™ AR experience we performed a study with 22 participants. Each participant
  installed in his/her smartphone the Thermojelly and played at the boardgame at home
  involving parents and friends (we required each participant to play with at least
  1 other player), after the play they filled out a questionnaire on the AR experience.
  Results showed that the play with the AR board was perceived as fluid and fun, and
  players appreciated in particular the possibility to personalize and build the play
  map, however the joystick control of the virtual avatar during the race was perceived
  as unnecessary complex to use, indicating that is required a easier interaction
  modality that should not require to touch the screen while the user is framing the
  board.'
