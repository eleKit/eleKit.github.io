abstract: Over the last years, social robots have been adopted to train children with
  Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) in socio-cognitive skills. Findings reveal that
  the social robots are well accepted by both children and stakeholders, thus opening
  the possibility to be used as effective tools to treat these children. In this paper
  awe show how with a robust iterative co-design process, an innovative platform that
  provides interactive activities between a NAO and a child with ASC can be designed
  and developed. This iterative collaborative process has allowed to refine technical
  and functional requirements to arrive to a platform design that can be easily implemented
  on one side and to a set of tasks that are relevant and useful for clinics.
