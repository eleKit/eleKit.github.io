 abstract = {Over the last years, social robots have been adopted to train children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) in socio-cognitive skills. Findings reveal that the social robots are well accepted by both children and stakeholders, thus opening the possibility to be used as effective tools to treat these children. In this paper awe show how with a robust iterative co-design process, an innovative platform that provides interactive activities between a NAO and a child with ASC can be designed and developed. This iterative collaborative process has allowed to refine technical and functional requirements to arrive to a platform design that can be easily implemented on one side and to a set of tasks that are relevant and useful for clinics.},
