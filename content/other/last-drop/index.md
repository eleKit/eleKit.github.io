The Last Drop is a mix between puzzle and platformer, this video-game exploits the giroscope of common smartphones to control the last drop falling from the sky. You should save the drop from obstacles and danger to save the forest. I developed the game prototype in 2017 for Videogame Design and Programming course at Politecnico di Milano.
