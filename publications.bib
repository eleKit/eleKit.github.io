abstract = {The project aims to explore the game mechanics to design a competitive AR board game that enables interaction between players. We explore existing best practices of AR design, and apply them in the development of Themojelly, a local multiplayer board game in AR for smartphones that integrates virtual elements with tangible interfaces. In Thermojelly, each player controls with a joystick shown on his/her smartphone a virtual avatar, with the shape of a jelly, and can play with two different party mini-games, both with the play goal to run and jump across the path designed using the physical board. The board is composed of 8 squared tiles and the players will personalize the map by placing the tiles on a desk, each tile represents an obstacle or an help for the avatar to race to the goal. The players can place the tiles both horizontally or at different heights (for example putting a tile on a pile of books), exploring different physical interaction modalities. The coordinates of all the virtual objects are computed with respect to a shared physical space: for a fluid AR multiplayer each player with the smartphone will have a different point of view of the same real and virtual worlds. Through this approach different players share the same play space, and visualize in contemporary all the events happening in the game from different points of view. To assess usability and players’ AR experience we performed a study with 22 participants. Each participant installed in his/her smartphone the Thermojelly and played at the boardgame at home involving parents and friends (we required each participant to play with at least 1 other player), after the play they filled out a questionnaire on the AR experience. Results showed that the play with the AR board was perceived as fluid and fun, and players appreciated in particular the possibility to personalize and build the play map, however the joystick control of the virtual avatar during the race was perceived as unnecessary complex to use, indicating that is required a easier interaction modality that should not require to touch the screen while the user is framing the board.},

abstract = {Introduction
This study presents MiEmo, a multi-modal digital platform designed to improve emotion recognition in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). The platform integrates serious games with music and color as feedback mechanisms to strengthen emotion understanding in addition to traditional visual interventions such as pictures and videos. The study aims to assess the usability and potential effectiveness of MiEmo in supporting therapy for children with medium- and high-functioning ASC.
Methods
A pilot usability study was conducted in two rehabilitation centers involving 19 children, 8 with medium and 11 with high functioning ASC. Participants engaged with six training activities, or exergames, on the MiEmo platform that implemented multi-modal feedback (music pieces and colored animations associated to the emotion). The System Usability Scale (SUS) and qualitative feedback from therapists were used to evaluate the platform's usability.
Results
The average SUS scores were 86.88 for children with medium-functioning ASC and 96.75 for those with high-functioning ASC, indicating positive usability. Therapists noted that while the platform was well-received, further updates are needed for better adaptation to medium-functioning children. Multi-modal feedback, particularly music and color, was found to enhance emotion recognition, with children responding well to the integration of these sensory cues.
Conclusion
The study demonstrates that MiEmo has significant potential as a tool for socio-emotional training, particularly for high-functioning children. However, limitations such as the small sample size, short intervention duration, and lack of a control group suggest that future studies with larger participant groups are necessary to validate these findings and assess long-term effects.}

Findings reveal that the social robots are well accepted by both children and stakeholders, thus opening the possibility to be used as effective tools to treat these children. In this paper awe show how with a robust iterative co-design process, an innovative platform that provides interactive activities between a NAO and a child with ASC can be designed and developed. This iterative collaborative process has allowed to refine technical and functional requirements to arrive to a platform design that can be easily implemented on one side and to a set of tasks that are relevant and useful for clinics.",
